# Welcome to Cypher @ Calhacks 12.0

## Inspiration

We wanted to reinvent how people learn languages.

Traditional apps focus on memorizing vocabulary, not real communication.

We imagined what Duolingo would look like if it were built today — powered by AI conversations, emotion, and context.


## What it does

Cypher helps users learn languages through real-life conversations, not textbook drills.

It adapts lessons based on your goals — whether you’re traveling, meeting new friends, or working abroad — and teaches through contextual chat and interactive quizzes.


## How we built it

We built Cypher using Typescript, React, Tailwind, and Framer Motion for a clean, futuristic UI. All lessons are compiled by ourselves. 

AI conversations are powered by Gemini API, with Mandarin speech through Microsoft Azure.

Firebase manages user login, progress, and personalized data.

Sound, quizzes, and tone practice all share a unified playback and learning system.


## Challenges we ran into

- Designing a system that adjusts difficulty dynamically as users progress.

- Training the chat model to recognize and maintain context in realistic dialogues.

- Implementing audio playback across multiple components — lessons, cards, and quizzes.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Built a fully functional AI-driven Duolingo reimagined in under 36 hours.

- Integrated multilingual chat, toggle functionalities, contextual learning paths, and sound-based tone practice.

- Created a cohesive visual identity that feels sleek, minimal, and futuristic.


## What we learned

We learned that teaching a language isn’t just about building AI — it’s about understanding people.
Designing Cypher pushed us to think deeply about how humans learn, feel, and connect through language.

We realized that the best learning experiences are not just smart but empathetic — meeting users where they are, adapting to their pace, and making every interaction feel human.


## What's next for Cypher: Learn Languages Through Context

Next, we’ll expand Cypher to support English, Japanese, and Spanish, add voice conversation mode, and refine our AI friend personalities for more natural dialogue.

Our goal is simple — make fluency feel as intuitive as texting your friends.
